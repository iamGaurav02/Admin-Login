# Admin-Login
This project combines an admin login system with an Oracle SQL database. Admins can handle user accounts: create, update, or delete them, and access user details. Using JSP, XHTML, XML, JavaScript, and CSS, the project provides a simple, user-friendly interface for admins to manage these tasks smoothly.
